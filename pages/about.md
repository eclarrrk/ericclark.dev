## I work at the front of front-end development

I call myself a Front-End Web Designer and Developer, which means something different to each person that hears it. When describing myself, I use the term to say that I plan, design, and develop websites.


### Website Research and Strategy

Companies have challenges or objectives they need help figuring outâ€”whether they realize it or not. I do my best to understand what the company does, what they're selling, and to who they're selling. I share observations and provide recommendations of how we could build a site that better represents the company.
