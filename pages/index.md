## I organize a meetup.

Since July 2015, the Lancaster Front-end Meetup has been a place to share, learn, and discuss topics relating to front-end design and development. We meet every first Wednesday at <a href="https://candyissweet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Candy Factory</a> in Lancaster, PA.
